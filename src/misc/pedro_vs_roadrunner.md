# Pedro Pathing vs Road Runner

[**Pedro Pathing**](https://pedropathing.com) and
[**RoadRunner**](https://rr.brott.dev) are two popular autonomous movement
libraries for FTC. The goal of this article is to provide an unbiased
comparison to help you decide which to use. The goal of this article is
**not** to recommend one over the other.

| Coordinate System       | Custom coordinate system. Provides a [`PoseConverter`](https://github.com/Pedro-Pathing/PedroPathing/blob/main/ftc/src/main/java/com/pedropathing/ftc/PoseConverter.java) for converting to and from the official FIRST coordinate system.                                                                                                  | Uses the official FIRST coordinate system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Command System          | Does not come with a built-in command system, <br/>although can be integrated with others. [NextFTC](https://nextftc.dev) and [SolversLib](https://docs.seattlesolvers.com) both provide built-in integration with Pedro Pathing. Mercurial has [two sample repos](https://docs.dairy.foundation/Samples/user_samples) using Pedro Pathing. | Has a built-in actions system. Also has an example on the docs for usage with FTCLib. [NextFTC](https://nextftc.dev) provides built-in integration with RoadRunner. Mercurial has [two sample repos](https://docs.dairy.foundation/Samples/user_samples) using RoadRunner. |
| Logging                 | Automatically logs many values to telemetry, but does not log to a file. Data such as current position can be logged by the user by using a third-party library such as [PsiKit](https://psilynx.github.io/PsiKit) for replay with [AdvantageScope](https://advantagescope.org).                                                            | Logs many values automatically to telemetry and to a file during every OpMode run.[^logs] Uses a custom log format that is supported by [AdvantageScope](https://advantagescope.org).                                                                                      |
| Drivetrain Support      | Has built-in support for mecanum drivetrains. Users can provide a custom implementation of the `Drivetrain` interface to use another drivetrain[^custom-drivetrain], but does not support nonholonomic drivetrains such as tank.                                                                                                            | Has built-in support for mecanum and tank drivetrains. Does not support any other drivetrains.[^rr-drivetrains]                                                                                                                                                            |
